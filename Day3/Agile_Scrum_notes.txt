Choose an User Story from Product Backlog and we create sprint backlog

Sprint :
  sprint1:	Plan --> Build --> Test ---> Deploy --> Review (not accepted)  
  sprint2:      Plan ---> Build --> Test  ---> Deploy --> Review (accepted)


Backlogs ---> Set of Requirements

User Story --> Use Case / Backlog / Requirement

Tasks ---> Decomposing backlog/user story into smaller components
Sprint? :  Production of any backlog is known as Sprint.

Horizon = Schedule

Sprint Retrospective: What is already achieved / what is achieving / what is going to be achieve
BurnDown Chart --->  task status/days/efforts



JIRA --> Tracking Tool
